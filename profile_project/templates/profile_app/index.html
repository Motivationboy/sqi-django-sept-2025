<!-- Create a Django project inside a folder named profile_project and an app called profile_app.
Inside profile_app/templates/profile_app/, create three separate HTML files:
index.html – This page should display "Welcome to My Profile" inside a div.
hobbies.html – This page should list three hobbies inside a ul (unordered list) within a div.
goals.html – This page should display three personal or career goals inside separate p tags within a div.
Each page should have a proper structure, including a title, an h1 heading, and a div wrapping the content.
Make sure all three pages can be accessed from the browser. -->
